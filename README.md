# Symbol Script

Scripting language for the insane.
Getting tired of all of the languages out there?
Me too.
So I decided to throw some more flame on the fire.
Here is another language for you to write buggy code.
Remember: don't enjoy using this language (it is forbidden).


## Motivation

I didn't like BASH.
Yup, that was why I wrote this.
I like the ease of commands in BASH.
I liked how Haskell looked.
I thought up an idea for a language that may be so insanely flexible there are bound to be fun research opportunities.
Also, with annotations, why not generate code for other languages? This gives the ability to better test and export your code.
Really, this is just a creative, exploratory outlet for me.
